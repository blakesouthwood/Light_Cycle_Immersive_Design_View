<title>Light Cycle Conceptual Design Logic Flow View</title>


</head>
<body> 
This program is currently in the concept phase. The more that<br>
I think about it the more I envision it as an interactive design<br>
tool to help think about the program from the human's and machine's<br>
perspective which are both completely different. I believe this will<br>
inevitably have several modes, levels, and perspectives as a tool.<br>
<br>
Fred Brooks mentioned in the beginning of the Mythical Man Month<br>
book "The essence of a software entity is a construct of interlocking concepts:"<br>
This perspective that he described is incomprehensible by the computer<br>
but it serves as an aid to humans to "undestand a program."<br>
At the same time Edsger Dijkstra said, "We create machine behavior."<br>
"I believe the hard part of building software to be the specification,<br>
 design, and testing of this conceptual construct, not the labor of <br>
 representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation." (Brooks 1987)<br>

<br>
The importance of design is paramount and as programs evolve,<br>
morph, and grow in complexity they become increasingly more<br>
difficult to comprehend and grasp conceptually. The purpose<br>
of this graphic game-like vision is to go inside a program<br>
within the design (not the actual code) from a different representation <br>
for better understanding by humans - the creators. <br>
<br><br>
With each new program I built the complexity becomes crushing and there<br>
are so many things to contend with and this way the intangible will<br>
become tangible. This way it will be a useful guide to get unstuck<br>
and fully comprehend what code is doing since it will be described<br>
at the documentation level behaviorally (running mode) and <br>
in the static boolean logic.<br>
<br>
This would be an interactive graphic game like perspective of <br>
going through a program at the function level and inside functions.<br>
I was inspired by the movie "The Fantastic Voyage" when they went<br>
through the blood stream of a patient.<br>
<br>
This is to assist a programmer in designing and testing their<br>
programs and components by a simulation of riding through the<br>
program on a horizontal grid, with a map view in the corner<br>
as if they are the Tron Cycle riding through the program at either<br>
the function level from function to function on that path route<br>
or at the lower level going through an algorithms flow of control.<br>
<br><br>
There will be road signs and it's all for the human perspective<br>
to aid the thinking process and for testing and to provide a way<br>
of going into a program through a simulation from the design<br>
view though it's just another representation and the computer<br>
knows nothing about it. It's a radical interface view concept.<br>
<br><br>
All my friends player games like Halo, Call of Duty, and other<br>
first player movies and this way a programmer can be immersed <br>
on the grid and in addition to my other concept of map view<br>
this gets down to the boolean logic level to understand a function<br>
better by going through the flow of control so it should offer<br>
a unique perspective.<br>
<br><br>
At the same time there will be a way of tracing the code flow of control<br>
so a human programmer can review it kind of like Myst by clicking or movie<br>
mode going through it like a driving game set at the speed they wish.<br>
<br>
This was inspired by Wolfenstein and Doom and Quake of course and Myst.<br>
<br>
Further it would show the design perspective and help to get the logic<br>
right also hopefully. <br>
